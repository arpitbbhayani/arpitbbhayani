I am a software engineer passionate about System Architecture, Language Internals, Distributed Datastores, and Advanced Algorithms. In 2024, I took the leap of faith and co-founded [Duggup](https://duggup.com), where I am operating as the CTO taking of all things tech.

Before co-founding Duggup, I was a Staff Engineer at [Google](https://cloud.google.com/) leading the [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) India team in providing managed big data ecosystem to GCP customers. I hold 10+ years of experience in building and scaling backend services across domains and companies like [Unacademy](https://unacademy.com/), [Amazon](https://www.amazon.in/), [Practo](https://www.practo.com/), and [D. E. Shaw](https://www.deshawindia.com/).

I keep diving deep into engineering details and share my learnings across my [socials](https://twitter.com/arpit_bhayani) and videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani). To put my learning to practice, I keep building things on the side and a few of my good hobby projects include

-   [DiceDB](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) - a re-implementation of Redis in Go
-   [Revine](https://revine.arpitbhayani.me) - a visual programming language for kids

You can find me on my socials below where, apart from engineering topics, I talk about career growth and how to become a better engineer.
