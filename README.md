I am a software engineer and an engineering leader passionate about Databases, System Architecture, and Advanced Algorithms. I am also the creator and maintainer of [DiceDB](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) - an open-source in-memory database.

In 2024, I took a leap of faith and co-founded [Profile.fyi](https://profile.fyi), which was later acquired by Mercor. Today, I am a Staff Engineer at [Google](https://cloud.google.com/), leading the Ads Forecasting. Before this, I had led the [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) India team, where we built a managed big data ecosystem for GCP customers, enabling them to handle data at scale seamlessly. Earlier in my journey, I was part of [Amazon's](https://www.amazon.com/) Fast Data Team, where I worked on cold tiering of hot data and developed a seamless query interface across all storage tiers.

I held engineering leadership positions (both IC and management) at [Unacademy](https://unacademy.com/), where I built, grew, and led Search, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, and Data Engineering teams. I hold a total of 10+ years of experience in scaling backend services, taking products and teams from 0 to 1, and beyond.

I keep diving deep into engineering details and share my learnings by across my [socials](https://twitter.com/arpit_bhayani) and videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani).
