I am a software engineer and an engineering leader passionate about System Architecture, Databases Internals, Language Internals, and Advanced Algorithms. I am the creator and maintainer of [DiceDB](https://github.com/dicedb/dice) - a database hyper-optimized to build real-time applications with its SQL-based reactivity.

In 2024, I took the leap of faith and co-founded [Profile.fyi](https://profile.fyi), where I am operating as the CTO taking care of all things tech. Before this, I was a Staff Engineer at [Google](https://cloud.google.com/) leading the [Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc) India team in providing a managed big data ecosystem to GCP customers. I was also part of [Amazon's](https://www.amazon.com/) Fast Data Team and took care of cold tiering of hot data and providing a seamless query interface across all tiers.

I held engineering leadership positions (both IC and management) at [Unacademy](https://unacademy.com/), where I built, grew, and led Search, Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams, and Data Engineering teams. I hold a total of 10+ years of experience in scaling backend services, taking products and teams from 0 to 1, and beyond.

I keep diving deep into engineering details and share my learnings by across my [socials](https://twitter.com/arpit_bhayani) and videos on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/ArpitBhayani).
